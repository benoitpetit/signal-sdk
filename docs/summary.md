## Documentation Flow

The documentation follows a logical progression:

```
Installation → Device Linking → Getting Started → API Reference → Examples → Troubleshooting
```

### For Beginners

1. **Install** the SDK
2. **Link device** (mandatory)
3. **Send first message**
4. **Learn from examples**

### For Developers

1. **API Reference** for complete method documentation
2. **Examples Guide** for practical implementations
3. **Advanced techniques** and best practices

### For Problem Solving

1. **Troubleshooting Guide** for common issues
2. **Debug techniques**
3. **Community support**

## Key Features Documented

### SignalCli Class (Core SDK)

  - Common questions and answers
  - Best practices
  - Security recommendations

## Code Examples

- **8 fully functional examples** covering all major features
- **Production-ready code** with error handling
- **Step-by-step instructions** for running each example

## Navigation and Structure

- **Logical file structure** in the `docs/` directory
- **Consistent formatting** and clear headings
- **Cross-linking** between all relevant sections
- **`summary.md`** file to provide a high-level overview

## How to Use the Documentation

1. **Start with `README.md`**: Get a quick overview and find the right starting point.
2. **Follow the logical flow**: `Installation` → `Device Linking` → `Getting Started`.
3. **Refer to the `API Reference`**: For detailed information on classes and methods.
4. **Explore the `Examples Guide`**: To see practical implementations.
5. **Consult the `Troubleshooting Guide`**: When you encounter issues.

This new documentation structure ensures that developers can quickly find the information they need, from getting started to advanced topics, all in a clear and organized manner.
